The primary objective is to develop a cutting-edge chatbot tailored for providing technical support and sales assistance in the animal agriculture domain, with a particular emphasis on beef cattle nutrition.  
This project strategically utilizes authoritative sources, primarily targeting the 'Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle: Eighth Revised Edition (2016).' However, due to the unavailability of a digital version of this edition, we have opted to use the 'Seventh Revised Edition: Update 2000,' from which we extracted the mineral nutrition chapter. This decision allows us to showcase the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and ML-Driven Prompt Engineering in creating a chatbot that functions as an expert beef nutritionist assistant, utilizing data from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  
This initiative represents the foundational step towards harnessing advanced technologies for enhancing knowledge dissemination and support within this sector.
