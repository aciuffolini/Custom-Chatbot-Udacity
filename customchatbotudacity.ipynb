    "The primary objective is to develop a cutting-edge chatbot tailored for providing technical support and sales assistance in the animal agriculture domain, with a particular emphasis on beef cattle nutrition.  \n",
    "This project strategically utilizes authoritative sources, primarily targeting the 'Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle: Eighth Revised Edition (2016).' However, due to the unavailability of a digital version of this edition, we have opted to use the 'Seventh Revised Edition: Update 2000,' from which we extracted the mineral nutrition chapter. This decision allows us to showcase the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and ML-Driven Prompt Engineering in creating a chatbot that functions as an expert beef nutritionist assistant, utilizing data from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  \n",
    "This initiative represents the foundational step towards harnessing advanced technologies for enhancing knowledge dissemination and support within this sector.\n"

Calciumrequirements are similar to those in the previous editionof this volume (National Research Council, 1984) becausenew information is not sufficient to justify a change. Themaintenance requirement was calculated as 15.4 mg Ca/kg body weight (Hansard et al., 1954, 1957). Retainedneeds in excess of maintenance requirements werecalculated as 7.1 g Ca/100 g protein gain. Calcium contentof gain was calculated from slaughter data (Ellenbergeret al., 1950). The calcium requirement for lactation inexcess of maintenance needs was calculated as 1.23 g Ca/kg milk produced. Fetal calcium content was assumed tobe 13.7 g Ca/kg fetal weight. This requirement wasdistributed over the last 3 months of pregnancy.\n",

Lower absorption valueshave been obtained in older cattle, but in many instancescalcium intake may have exceeded dietary requirementsin these animals (Hansard et al., 1954, 1957; Martz etal., 1990). Absorption of calcium is largely determinedby requirement relative to intake. True calcium absorptionis reduced when intake exceeds the animal’s need. TheAgricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC) recentlyused a value of 68 percent absorption to calculate calciumrequirements of cattle (TCORN, 1991).\n",

      "Calcium is absorbed primarily from the duodenum and\n",
      "jejunum by both active transport and passive diffusion(McDowell, 1992). It should be noted that diets high in fatmay decrease calcium absorption through the formation ofsoaps (Oltjen, 1975). Vitamin D is required for activeabsorption of calcium (DeLuca, 1979). The amount ofcalcium absorbed is affected by the chemical form and sourceof the calcium, the interrelationships with other nutrients,and the animal’s requirement. Requirement is influenced bysuch factors as age, weight, and type and stage of production.In natural feedstuffs, calcium occurs in oxalate or phytateform. In alfalfa hay, 20 to 33 percent was present as insolublecalcium oxalate and apparently unavailable to the animal(Ward et al., 1979). True absorption of alfalfa calcium wasmuch lower than absorption of corn silage calcium whenfed to dairy cows (Martz et al., 1990). In cattle fed high-concentrate diets, dietary calcium in excess of requirementsimproved gain or feed efficiency in some studies (Huntington,1983; Brink et al., 1984; Bock et al., 1991). Improvementsin performance were likely the result of manipulation ofdigestive tract function and may not represent a specificcalcium requirement. Increasing calcium from 0.25 to 0.40or 1.11 percent reduced organic matter and starch digestionin the rumen but increased postruminal digestion of organicmatter and starch (Goetsch and Owens, 1985). In finishingcattle fed a high-concentrate diet, increasing calcium morethan 0.3 percent increased gain in one of two trials but didnot affect calcium status based on bone calcium, bone ash,and plasma ionizable calcium concentrations (Huntington,1983).\n",

With early spring pastures, the problem ismore one of insufficient availability rather than low foragemagnesium concentrations per se. Fertilizing pastures withfertilizers high in nitrogen and potassium is associatedwith increased incidence of grass tetany. Cows depend ona frequent supply of magnesium from the gastrointestinaltract to maintain normal blood magnesium concentrationsbecause homeostatic mechanisms are not sufficient toregulate blood magnesium concentrations. Magnesiumconcentrations in bone are high, but mature animals lackthe ability to mobilize large amounts of magnesium frombone (Rook and Storry, 1962). In young calves, at least30 percent of the skeletal magnesium can be mobilizedduring magnesium deficiency (Blaxter et al., 1954).\n",

A number of studies have shownthat high-dietary potassium reduces magnesium absorption(Greene et al., 1983; Wylie et al., 1985).

Magnesium absorptionhas been enhanced by feeding soluble carbohydrates orcarboxylic ionophores (Fontenot et al., 1989; Spears et al.,1989). Evidence suggests that magnesium absorption fromthe rumen occurs by an active sodium-linked process (Martensand Rayssiguier, 1980), and sodium supplementation in alow-sodium diet increases magnesium absorption (Martenset al., 1987). It has also been reported that different breedsabsorb magnesium differently (Greene et al., 1989). Excessmagnesium absorbed is excreted primarily in the urine.\n",

Studies in SouthAfrica and Texas of cattle that grazed forages low inphosphorus showed large improvements in fertility andcalf weaning weights with phosphorus supplementation(Dunn and Moss, 1992). Phosphorus deficiency results inreduced growth and feed efficiency, decreased appetite,impaired reproduction, reduced milk production, andweak, fragile bones (Underwood, 1981; Shupe et al., 1988).The skeleton provides a large reserve of phosphorus thatcan be drawn on during periods of inadequate phosphorusintake in mature animals. Skeletal reserves cansubsequently be replaced during periods when phosphorusintake is high relative to requirements. Plasma phosphorusconcentrations consistently below 4.5 mg/dL are indicativeof a deficiency, but bone phosphorus is a more sensitivemeasure of phosphorus status (McDowell, 1992).\n",

Varying endogenousfecal excretion is an important homeostatic mechanismfor controlling phosphorus in cattle. Endogenous fecallosses consist largely of unabsorbed salivary phosphorus(Challa et al., 1989). Salivary phosphorus is affected byplasma phosphorus concentration, which does depend onphosphorus intake as well as factors that affect salivaryflow such as dry matter intake and physical form of thediet (TCORN, 1991). Thus, fecal endogenous loss ofphosphorus may vary depending on intake and otherfactors that affect salivary phosphorus. In estimating themaintenance requirement, it is important that endogenousfecal excretion of phosphorus be measured in cattle fedapproximately their phosphorus requirement. Urinarylosses of phosphorus are generally lower but may increasein cattle fed high-concentrate diets (Reed et al., 1965).\n",

      "Absorption of selenium in ruminants is much lower thanin nonruminants (Wright and Bell, 1966). The lowerabsorption of selenium is believed to relate to the reductionof selenite to insoluble forms in the rumen. Fecal excretionis greater than urinary excretion in mature ruminants.Pulmonary excretion of selenium is important when intakesof selenium are high (Ganther et al., 1966).\n",

      "clinical sign of selenium deficiency that results indegeneration and necrosis in both skeletal and cardiacmuscle (Underwood, 1981). Affected animals may showstiffness, lameness, or even cardiac failure. Other signs ofselenium deficiency that have been observed includeunthriftiness (often times with weight loss and diarrhea;Underwood, 1981), anemia with presence of heinz bodies(Morris et al., 1984), and increased mortality and reducedcalf weaning weights (Spears et al., 1986). Selenium-depleted cattle have shown reduced immune responses ina number of studies (Stabel and Spears, 1993). Arthur etal. (1988) reported that selenium-deficient cattle hadincreased T\n",

      "relative to selenium-supplemented cattle. Depressedactivity of iodothyronine 5-deiodinase may explain theunthriftiness and poor growth often observed in seleniumdeficiency. Decreases in glutathione peroxidase activityassociated with selenium deficiency can explain theoccurrence of white muscle disease, heinz body anemia,and possibly other signs of selenium deficiency.\n",
      "Selenium concentrations in plasma, serum, and whole\n",
      "blood, and glutathione peroxidase activities in plasma,whole blood, and erythrocytes, have been used to assessselenium status. Glutathione peroxidase activitiesindicative of a selenium deficiency can vary from onelaboratory to another depending on assay conditions.Langlands et al. (1989b) concluded from a number of on-farm studies with cattle in Australia that seleniumconcentrations in whole blood and plasma were poorindicators of responsiveness to selenium supplementationunless unthriftiness was apparent.\n",
      "SELENIUM SOURCES\n",
      "Feedstuffs grown in many areas of the United States and\n",
      "Canada are deficient or at least marginally deficient inselenium. Selenium-deficient areas are located in thenorthwestern, northeastern, and southeastern parts of theUnited States. The selenium content of forages and otherfeedstuffs varies greatly depending on plant species andparticularly the selenium content of the soil. Seleniumcan legally be supplemented in beef cattle diets to provide3 mg/head/day or 0.3 mg/kg in the complete diet. Alternate\n",
      "methods of supplementing selenium include injectingselenium every 3 to 4 months or at critical productionstages and using boluses retained in the rumen that releaseselenium over a period of months (Hidiroglou et al., 1985;Campbell et al., 1990).\n",
      "SIGNS OF SELENIUM TOXICITY\n",
      "Selenium toxicity may occur as a result of excessive selenium\n",
      "supplementation or consumption of plants naturally high inselenium. Many plant species of Astragalus  and Stanleya\n",
      "grow primarily on seleniferous areas and can accumulateup to 3,000 mg Se/kg. Consumption of forages containing 5to 40 mg Se/kg results in chronic toxicosis (alkali disease).Chronic toxicity signs include lameness, anorexia,emaciation, loss of vitality, sore feet, cracked, deformed andelongated hoofs, liver cirrhosis, nephritis, and loss of hairfrom the tail (Rosenfeld and Beath, 1964). Acute seleniumtoxicity (blind staggers) causes labored breathing, diarrhea,ataxia, abnormal posture, and death from respiratory failure(National Research Council, 1980). The maximum tolerableconcentration of selenium has been estimated to be 2 mg/kg(National Research Council, 1980). The addition of 10 mgSe/kg to a milk replacer for 42 days reduced gain andefficiency in young calves, but supplemented selenium at 5mg/kg caused no noticeable effects (Jenkins and Hidiroglou,1986).\n",
      "Zinc\n",
      "Zinc functions as an essential component of a number of\n",
      "important enzymes. In addition, other enzymes areactivated by zinc. Enzymes that require zinc are involvedin nucleic acid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism(Hambidge et al., 1986). Zinc also is important for normaldevelopment and functioning of the immune system.\n",
      "ZINC REQUIREMENTS\n",
      "The recommended requirement of zinc in beef cattle diets\n",
      "is 30 mg Zn/kg diet. This concentration should satisfyrequirements in most situations. Pond and Oltjen (1988)reported no growth responses to zinc supplementation inmedium- or large-framed steers fed corn silage-corn-baseddiets containing 22 to 26 mg Zn/kg. Growth responses tozinc supplementation were observed in two of four studieswith finishing steers fed diets containing 18 to 29 mg Zn/kg (Perry et al., 1968). In later studies, zinc added to dietscontaining 17 to 21 mg Zn/kg improved gain in only oneof seven experiments (Beeson et al., 1977). Other studieswith growing and finishing cattle have indicated no responseto zinc supplementation when diets contained 22 to 32 mgZn/kg (Pringle et al., 1973; Spears and Samsell,\n",

      "diets and requirements for reproduction and milk productionare less well defined. Zinc supplementation increased gainin nursing calves grazing mature forages that contained 7to 17 mg Zn/kg (Mayland et al., 1980).\n",
      "SIGNS OF ZINC DEFICIENCY\n",
      "Severe zinc deficiency in cattle results in reduced growth,\n",
      "feed intake, and feed efficiency; listlessness; excessivesalivation; reduced testicular growth; swollen feet withopen, scaly lesions; parakeratotic lesions that are mostsevere on the legs, neck, head, and around the nostrils;failure of wounds to heal; and alopecia (Miller and Miller,1962; Miller et al., 1965; Ott et al., 1965; Mills et al.,1967). Thymus atrophy and impaired immune responsehave been observed in calves with a genetic disorder thatcauses impaired absorption of zinc, resulting in zincdeficiency (Perryman et al., 1989). Subclinical deficienciesof zinc can reduce weight gain (Mayland et al., 1980)and perhaps reproductive performance. Plasma or liverzinc concentrations may be used to diagnose severe zincdeficiencies, but plasma zinc determination is of little valuein detecting marginal deficiencies. Stress or disease causesa redistribution of zinc in the body that can temporarilyresult in low plasma concentrations characteristic of asevere deficiency (Hambridge et al., 1986).\n",
      "FACTORS AFFECTING ZINC REQUIREMENTS\n",
      "Absorption of zinc occurs primarily from the abomasum\n",
      "and small intestine (Miller and Cragle, 1965). Zincabsorption is homeostatically controlled and cattle adjustthe percentage of dietary zinc absorbed based on theirneed for growth or lactation (Miller, 1975). Milk contains3 to 5 mg Zn/L, but the increased demand for milkproduction is likely met by increased absorption, providedthat dietary zinc is present in a form that can be absorbed.Dietary factors that affect zinc requirements in ruminantsare not understood. In contrast to nonruminants, high-dietary calcium does not appear to increase zincrequirements greatly in ruminants (Pond, 1983; Pond andWallace, 1986). Phytate also does not affect zinc absorptionin ruminants with a functional rumen. A relatively largeportion of the zinc in forages is associated with the plantcell wall (Whitehead et al., 1985), but it is not knownwhether zinc’s association with fiber reduces absorption.\n",
      "ZINC SOURCES\n",
      "The zinc content of forages is affected by a number of\n",
      "factors including plant species, maturity, and soil zinc(Minson, 1990). Legumes are generally higher in zinc thangrasses. Cereal grains usually contain between 20 and 30mg Zn/kg, whereas plant protein sources contain 50 to 70\n",
      "mg Zn/kg. Feed-grade sources of bioavailable zinc includezinc oxide, zinc sulfate, zinc methionine, and zincproteinate. Based on available data, zinc in the sulfateand oxide form are of similar bioavailability in ruminants(Kincaid, 1979; Kegley and Spears, 1992). Absorption ofzinc from zinc methionine is similar to zinc oxide, butzinc methionine appears to be metabolized differentlyfollowing absorption (Spears, 1989).\n",
      "SIGNS OF ZINC TOXICITY\n",
      "The amount of zinc necessary to cause toxicity is much\n",
      "greater than requirements. The maximum tolerableconcentration of zinc is 500 mg/kg (National ResearchCouncil, 1980). Decreased weight gain was reported incalves fed 900 mg Zn/kg for 12 weeks (Ott et al., 1966).Young calves fed milk replacer tolerated 500 mg Zn/kgfor 5 weeks without adverse effects; but 700 mg/kg reducedgain, feed intake, and feed efficiency (Jenkins andHidiroglou, 1991).\n",

However, approximately 10-20 mg of copper per head per day is recommended for beef cattle. It is important to consult a veterinarian or nutritionist to determine the correct amount for your specific herd.  \n",

This amount should provide adequate copper if the diet does not exceed 0.25 percent sulfur and 2 mg Mo/kg diet.

       "**Original Answer:** The manganese requirement for beef cattle varies based on their age, body weight, and stage of production. Generally, the recommended minimum manganese requirement for beef cattle is 30 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of dry matter intake (DMI). This equates to approximately 30 mg of manganese per day for a 1,000-pound cow with a DMI of 2.5% of her body weight.\n",
       "\n",
       "During periods of high production, such as late pregnancy and lactation, the manganese requirement may increase to 40-50 mg per kg of DMI. On the other hand, growing and finishing cattle may require higher levels of manganese, such as 40-60 mg per kg of DMI.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important to note that soil conditions and diet composition can also affect the availability of manganese in the feed, so it is recommended to work with a veterinarian or animal nutritionist to determine the specific manganese needs for your beef cattle herd.  \n",
       "**Custom Answer:**   The manganese requirement for beef cattle varies depending on their stage of production. For growing and finishing cattle, the recommended concentration of manganese in the diet is 20 mg/kg. For breeding cattle, the recommended concentration is 40 mg/kg. Additionally, manganese requirements may be affected by factors such as breed, dietary factors, and the presence of other minerals such as molybdenum and sulfur. If the diet is not sufficient in manganese, it can result in skeletal abnormalities in young animals and low reproductive performance in older cattle. It is important to regularly assess and adjust the manganese levels in the diet to meet the specific needs of beef cattle.\n"

This is due to the interaction of sulfur and other minerals in the rumen, leading to the formation of thiomolybdates that can bind to copper and decrease its availability for metabolic functions. Additionally, high levels of sulfur can also decrease microbial protein synthesis and cause impaired utilization of lactate, ultimately affecting the overall health and performance of ruminant animals. Therefore, careful consideration of sulfur levels and supplementation is crucial in formulating balanced mineral requirements for livestock."

       "**Answer:** The sulfur levels in the diets that can generate those problems vary, but it is generally recommended to aim for a concentration of 0.15 percent sulfur in beef cattle diets. However, diets high in urea or other nonprotein nitrogen sources may require additional sulfur supplementation. Additionally, certain forages and crops such as sorghum or sorghum×sudangrass grown in sulfur-deficient soils may be inherently low in sulfur and may require supplementation. Sulfur can be supplemented in ruminant diets through various sources such as sodium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, calcium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, or elemental sulfur. It is important to carefully monitor the sulfur levels in diets and consult with a nutritionist to avoid potential toxicity and negative effects on animal health."

However, high levels of sulfur in the diet can lead to a thiamine deficiency, which may increase the risk of polioencephalomalacia. Additionally, sulfur toxicity can lead to neurological symptoms, which could potentially be mistaken for polioencephalomalacia. More research is needed to fully understand the role of sulfur in this condition."

    "Upon executing the code, it was observed that custom bots slightly outperformed proprietary LLMs in delivering precise, technically specific responses, highlighting their effectiveness in specialized contexts. Despite this, open-source LLMs emerge as a cost-efficient solution for expansive application deployment, where the meticulous selection of up-to-date, relevant database information is critical for maximizing utility. Integrating fine-tuning with RAG, alongside harnessing both foundational and cutting-edge knowledge via smaller, open-source models, appears to offer the best equilibrium in terms of performance on edge devices. This balance will probably reflects on adoption rates, scalability, practical utility, and cost-efficiency, emphasizing the ongoing evolution of proprietary knowledge bases and the potentially more significant disparities in smaller, open-source models. This situation necessitates continued R&D to capitalize on these advancements fully."
